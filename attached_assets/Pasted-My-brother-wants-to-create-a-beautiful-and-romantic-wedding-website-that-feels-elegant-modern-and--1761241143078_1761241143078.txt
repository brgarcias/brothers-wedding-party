My brother wants to create a beautiful and romantic wedding website that feels elegant, modern, and emotional.
The color palette should include soft tones like white, beige, blush pink, and gold, with a clean layout, smooth animations, and a warm, welcoming atmosphere.
At the top of the homepage, include a romantic slogan, such as:
“Two hearts, one love.”
or
“Our journey begins.”
or
“Forever starts here.”
The website should include the following sections:
🕊️ 1. Home Page
A beautiful hero section with the couple’s names, wedding date, and a large background photo of them together.
Add a short storytelling paragraph to introduce their love story, for example:
“Bruno and Ana’s story began by chance — a smile, a conversation, and an instant connection. Over time, that connection grew into something deeper: love, laughter, and endless memories. Now, they’re ready to celebrate their union with family and friends who have been part of their journey.”
Include a wedding countdown timer and a gentle background animation (like floating petals, light particles, or a soft gradient).
🎁 2. Gift List Page
A grid of wedding gifts, each displayed as a card with:
An image of the gift
A short title and description
A button to open a dedicated page for that gift
Each individual gift page should include:
A detailed description
One or more purchase links (Amazon, Mercado Livre, Shopee, etc.)
A personal note from the couple explaining why the gift matters to them
Optionally, a way for guests to mark the item as “purchased” or “reserved”
💝 3. Pix Donation Section
A Pix contribution area where guests can easily send money to help the couple start their new life together.
Include:
A Pix QR code
The couple’s Pix key
A copy button for convenience
A creative and elegant layout (for example, a small decorative card or popup modal)
Add a heartfelt message such as:
“Your love and generosity mean the world to us. Thank you for helping us build our future together.”
💬 4. Contact Page
A simple and friendly contact form where guests can send their greetings, wishes, or questions.
Include fields for name, email, and message, and a “Send with Love” button.
💍 5. Design & Style
Use romantic typography (e.g., elegant serif fonts combined with soft cursive accents)
Include subtle animations (fade-ins, smooth scrolling, floating petals, etc.)
Ensure the website is fully responsive, looking perfect on both mobile and desktop
Add a footer with the couple’s initials, wedding date, and social media links (optional)
✨ Overall Mood
The website should capture the feeling of love, gratitude, and celebration, while remaining simple, practical, and visually elegant.
Guests should enjoy browsing the gifts and feel emotionally connected to the couple’s story from the moment they open the site.
